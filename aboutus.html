                <p>
                    Often the people in society who are in need are the most overlooked.
                    Society and governments are not set up to protect everyone who needs it. 
                    That is why charities are here to fill the gaps and provide dedicated resources
                    to help the most vulnerable. For children, they rely on their parents or carers
                    to give them safety, guidance, and access to life is necessities. Sadly for many 
                    children, this is not the case. Many of them are orphan , and do not have money 
                    for education, guidance and daily needs. we provise such orpahage homes , old age homes
                    and NGO donar who are willing to donate necessay items which will help them for good 
                    survival.
